# progressChecker
This program helps you organize your progress. You can set subjects, set specific topics per subject, and specific questions per topic. It can tell you how much progress you have based on how many questions you have answered correctly. 

There are plans to create a UI for this, but currently you can create a new save file and input any information you want.
