# progressChecker
First project, using java OOP concepts 
Plan: 
Create a class of type subject
In the class subject, there are objects of topics 
The topics have questions, and you can indicate how many questions you want, and ea has respective answer 
Then use simple method to calculate your progress 
Constantly uses scanner class 

An extends could work too, for.. i suppose chores and it just doesn't have the answers? can do that later 

So I say, just get what you want generally working in text, and can learn how to make it perma-save later. And even later ui if time. 


When more experience, can create a perma-save, and also create a ui with it (java swing??)

End date: March 10th.. ??
